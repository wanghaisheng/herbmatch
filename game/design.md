# Herb Match - Game Design Document

## Overview
Herb Match is a match-3 puzzle game with educational elements about different medicinal herbs. The game features a battle pass system with various herb-themed reward tracks.

## Core Gameplay

- Swap adjacent herbs to create matches
- Earn points based on match length

## Level Design System

### Level Structure
Following industry practices from successful match-3 games, our levels are designed with:

1. **Progressive Difficulty**: Difficulty increases gradually to allow players to develop skills
2. **Varied Objectives**: Different objectives keep gameplay fresh and challenging
3. **Limited Resources**: Time constraints and move limitations create strategic decisions
4. **Recovery Periods**: Easier levels occasionally appear after difficult ones to maintain player motivation

### Level Types
1. **Score Target Levels**: Reach a specific score within the time limit
2. **Collection Levels**: Collect specific herb types (e.g., "Collect 15 Mint herbs")
3. **Obstacle Levels**: Clear special obstacles by matching herbs adjacent to them
4. **Combination Levels**: Combine multiple objectives (e.g., reach score + collect specific herbs)

### Difficulty Progression

### Detailed Level Design

#### Objective Balancing

#### Special Level Features

#### Board Configuration Variations
- **Standard Configuration**: Balanced distribution of herb types
- **Harvest Configuration**: Higher concentration of specific herbs (collection levels)
- **Restricted Configuration**: Limited herb variety for increased challenge
- **Obstacle Configuration**: Special tiles that must be cleared by adjacent matches

#### Level Completion Rewards
- 1 Star: Complete the primary objective
- 2 Stars: Complete the primary objective with 20% higher score
- 3 Stars: Complete the primary objective with 50% higher score and all secondary objectives

All star thresholds are carefully calibrated based on level difficulty to ensure consistent challenge throughout the game.
